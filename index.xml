      <description>Introduction This is my writeup for FSIIEC CTF.&#xA;Boss Password An obfuscated passage is given.&#xA;To deobfuscate the passage, look at the hint closely&amp;hellip; Hint The hint obviosuly states the key is &amp;ldquo;to be as sneaky as possible&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Just take the message literally and use it as a key to decode the message and convert the message to MD5 hash. Solved! Kagegakure To solve this challenge, I used curl -L command on Linux (Ubuntu) to read all the contents on the website.</description>

      <description>For this CTF, I only solved one question by myself, so here is the writeup for awa-jelly (reverse engineering)&#xA;Basically, the challenge is to recover the redacted input text so that the output is same as displayed.&#xA;Although I know Python a little, I decided to use the traditional method: Excel ü§¶üèª&#xA;Throughout my process, I tried to recover the scrambling algorithm by using Python, and I discovered some characters cannot be displayed after scrambling, which caused my natural approach to be weird due to some characters are missing.</description>
