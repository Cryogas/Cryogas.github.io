      <description>For this CTF, I only solved one question by myself, so here is the writeup for awa-jelly (reverse engineering)&#xA;Basically, the challenge is to recover the redacted input text so that the output is same as displayed.&#xA;Although I know Python a little, I decided to use the traditional method: Excel ü§¶üèª&#xA;Throughout my process, I tried to recover the scrambling algorithm by using Python, and I discovered some characters cannot be displayed after scrambling, which caused my natural approach to be weird due to some characters are missing.</description>
